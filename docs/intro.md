# ðŸ“˜ Introduction

Welcome to **Subcoin**, an innovative project aimed at introducing decentralized fast sync for the Bitcoin network. By leveraging the power of [Polkadot-SDK (formerly Substrate)](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk), Subcoin delivers a more efficient Bitcoin chain syncing process.

The key feature of Subcoin is decentralized fast sync, which allows new Bitcoin nodes to quickly catch up with the latest state of the blockchain without needing to download and verify every block from the genesis. This drastically reduces the time and computational resources required to join the Bitcoin network.

Additionally, Subcoin enhances Bitcoin Core's fast sync by enabling the download of a UTXO set (compatible with Bitcoin Core) directly from the Subcoin P2P network, removing the dependency on trusted snapshot providers in Bitcoin Core.

## Subcoinâ€™s Vision

Subcoin envisions building an ecosystem where Bitcoin benefits from modern blockchain architectures like Polkadot-SDK. Beyond solving the challenge of slow Bitcoin syncing, Subcoin paves the way for exciting new use cases, including new Bitcoin wallet integration, custom indexers, Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions, and more.
